                    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                    <p>Student Self Defense Advocates (SSDA) is a youth-led nonprofit dedicated to empowering students through self-defense education and advocacy. Founded in response to rising violence—especially against Asian American youth—SSDA provides free self-defense classes, creates awareness through social media, and promotes safer school environments.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is simple: help students feel safe, confident, and prepared—because every student deserves the power to protect themselves.</p>
